## IMAGE SUPER RESOLUTION PROJECT


This project based on deep learning mechanisms 
provides 3 models which can increase (7 x 7) to
(28 x 28) while keeping the global shape described
by the input image.

Models are composed by linear neural layers and 
convolutional neural layers.

We used the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and the [FashionMNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) databases
to train our models.

Special work has been done to make the project
as understandable as possible by a beginner.
All code blocks are explained by a commentary
just above these.


### Launch project
To launch the project easily you must import 
the collab notebooks in google collaboratory 
website at : colab.research.google.com/ 
and change the runtime mode to GPU.


### Collab notebook files

[Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebook files are placed in the directory
named "collab".


### Python files

[Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) source files are placed in the directory
named "python".


### Developed with
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/index.html)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
